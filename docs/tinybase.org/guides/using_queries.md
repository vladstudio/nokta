These guides discuss how to define queries that let you select specific [`Row`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/row/) and [`Cell`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/cell/) combinations from each [`Table`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/table/), and benefit from powerful features like grouping and aggregation.

## An Intro To Queries

This guide describes how the [`queries`](/api/queries/) module gives you the ability to create queries against [`Tables`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/tables/) in the [`Store`](/api/the-essentials/creating-stores/store/) - such as selecting specific [`Row`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/row/) and [`Cell`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/cell/) combinations from each [`Table`](/api/store/type-aliases/store/table/), or performing powerful features like grouping and aggregation.
