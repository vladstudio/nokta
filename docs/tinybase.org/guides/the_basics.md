These guides cover the very basics of TinyBase.

We start with common ways to install the modules and then learn about how to interact with [`Store`](/api/the-essentials/creating-stores/store/) objects including creation, reading data, writing data, and listening for changes.

See also the [Hello World](/demos/hello-world/) demos, and the [Todo App](/demos/todo-app/) demos.
