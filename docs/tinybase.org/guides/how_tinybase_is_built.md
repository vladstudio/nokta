These guides discuss how TinyBase is structured and some of the interesting ways in which it is architected, tested, and built.

Don't forget to also take a look at the code on GitHub and knock yourself out!

## Developing TinyBase

This guide is for people who would like to checkout the TinyBase code and build it from source. It's a quick overview of the common workflows. [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/developing-tinybase/).

## Architecture

The architecture of TinyBase is pretty straightforward. This guide runs through the main file structure and principles. [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/architecture/).

## Testing

Testing is a first-class citizen in TinyBase, as you may see from the high coverage it enjoys. [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/testing/).

## Documentation

Like testing, documentation is a first-class citizen of TinyBase, and most of it is structured as API documentation (from the `.d.ts` files) and from markdown pages. [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/documentation/).

## How The Demos Work

The demos on the TinyBase site deserve a little explanation. [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/how-the-demos-work/).

## Credits

I'm James. Building TinyBase was an interesting exercise in API design, minification, and documentation. But now people seem to like using it! [Read more](/guides/how-tinybase-is-built/credits/).
