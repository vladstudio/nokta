Console commands

You can register custom console commands using `app.rootCmd.addCommand(cmd)`, where `cmd` is a [Command](/jsvm/classes/Command.html) instance.

Here is an example:

`$app.rootCmd.addCommand(new Command({ use: "hello", run: (cmd, args) => { console.log("Hello world!") }, }))`

To run the command you can execute:

`./pocketbase hello`

Keep in mind that the console commands execute in their own separate app process and run independently from the main `serve` command (aka. hook and realtime events between different processes are not shared with one another).
